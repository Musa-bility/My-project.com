<p style="background-color:#a13b14;color:#Ffffff; padding: 60px; font-size:60px; margin: 20px;">Every one has a dream and want to accomplish it. Like any other technological advancement in human history, the benefits
gained by mankind from the computerization and digitization of our world come at a price. The more information we can store and transmit, the more it becomes vulnerable to theft or destruction. The more dependent our lives become on technology and on rapid, instantaneous communication, the greater are the <span="color:black">consequences of losing access to those capabilities.</span>It is not only possible, but in fact routine for billions of dollars to be transferred overseas in the blink of an eye. Entire libraries can be stored on devices no bigger than a human thumb. It is common to see toddlers playing rather mundane games on smartphones or tablets that have more computing power than machines which just 50 years ago would have filled entire rooms.</p>
